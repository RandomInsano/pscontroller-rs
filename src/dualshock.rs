//! Sony's DualShock Controllers
//! ============================
//! These guys everyone is familiar with, so for now there isn't
//! much of a description here!
//! 
//! This also maps for the the Dual Analog (precursor to the Dual Shock) and
//! the Analog controller (flight stick) as they both have the same buttons
