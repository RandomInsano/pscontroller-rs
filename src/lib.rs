//! Playstation Controller driver for Rust's [Embedded Hardware Abstraction Layer](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal)
//! ============================
//! 
//! The original PlayStation and most of its peripherals are 20+ years old at this point,
//! but they're easy to interface with for fun projects and wireless variants are easy
//! to come by while being [pretty cheap](https://www.amazon.ca/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=ps2+wireless+controller)
//! ($28 Canadian for two as of this writing).
//! 
//! The current state of this library is such that it's pretty na√Øve to which controller
//! is plugged in, and it will make a guess based on the response to a poll request. The
//! response is broken into a header with an identification byte and an acknowledge byte and
//! we use the whole identification byte and just assume the data its sending is correct.
//! 
//! If you own something particularly interesting for the PS1 or PS2 that plugs into the
//! controller port and isn't supported here, feel free to reach out by creating an issue
//! and we can work out some creative way to get the device working with this library.
//! 
//! Efficiencies can be made here, and things will likely improve, but the darn thing is
//! useful now so let's start using it! If you find things to fix, please make an issue.
//! 
//! Hardware
//! -----------------------
//! 
//! Because the PlayStation can have up to four devices sharing the same SPI bus (two
//! controllers and two memory cards), they made the data out (MISO) pin open drain. That
//! means that it can only pull the line low and you'll need to add your own resistor
//! connected from that pin to +5v. In my testing with a voltage divider on a PlayStation 2,
//! the value is between 220 and 500 ohms.
//! 
//! Development and testing is recommended to by done on a Raspberry Pi as it has a reliable
//! SPI bus. Early testing on both a Next Thing Co. C.H.I.P. and an Odroid C1+ didn't go
//! very well. The C.H.I.P. added unexpected clock changes, and the C1+ had voltage pull
//! up/down problems with the data lines.
//! 
//! The controller itself is a 3.3v logic device and any force feedback is meant to be
//! driven by the 7.5v cd-rom voltage. Testing using the 5v line on of the Raspberry Pi
//! technically works, but the result is much weaker than the original console.
//! 
//! Bibliography

//! and continue to provide a good cross-reference to double check the work done here.
